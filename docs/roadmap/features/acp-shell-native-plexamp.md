# ACP shell / native Plexamp modernisation

**Issue:** #94  
**Status:** QUEUED — next architectural track after #85

## Why this moves before Astronomy

Astronomy is a rich new application surface. Building it in the current multi-document navigation model and immediately migrating it would be avoidable rework.

#94 therefore starts with the UI foundation first. Astronomy may begin once that foundation is physically accepted; it does not need to wait for every final native-Plexamp lifecycle/resilience gate if the application-surface contract is already stable.

## Phase A — ACP UI foundation

- [ ] Prototype one long-lived ACP web document with top-level application surfaces instead of full document navigation.
- [ ] Establish an ACP component/design system: data → reusable components → design tokens → application surfaces.
- [ ] Prototype browser View Transitions for ACP-to-ACP surface changes.
- [ ] Prototype the native ACP desktop shell: bottom home indicator, swipe-up navigation, transition/workspace ownership and optional system keyboard.
- [ ] Prototype the spatial row/carousel as navigation mode, with exactly one committed destination transition.
- [ ] Benchmark Chromium and Firefox on the commissioned Pi; keep Chromium unless Firefox shows a meaningful appliance-level advantage.
- [ ] Preserve the existing ACP look and themes.
- [ ] Physically accept touch, transition smoothness, startup/recovery and 1280×720 presentation.

## Phase B — native Plexamp

- [ ] Install current ARM64 Linux Plexamp reversibly alongside the accepted runtime.
- [ ] Confirm visualisers on the real Pi/display and measure CPU/GPU cost.
- [ ] Prove native Plexamp can feed the accepted `acp_plexamp` ALSA boundary without bypassing ACP audio ownership.
- [ ] Classify Companion/playMedia/timeline compatibility for existing NFC tags and playback observation.
- [ ] Prove touchscreen Search/text entry.
- [ ] Integrate native Plexamp as a second compositor workspace/surface under the ACP shell.
- [ ] Prove alarm/AirPlay arbitration, Direct failback, reboot/autostart and rollback.
- [ ] Keep Headless until every native-player gate passes.
